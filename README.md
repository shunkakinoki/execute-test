POC to simulate txs to parse restults in human readable format, harnessing the power of [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

All credits go to [tx-simulation-snap/blob](https://github.com/FrederikBolding/tx-simulation-snap/blob/main/packages/snap/src/lib/tokens/erc721.ts) for the idea, [foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) & [ethers-rs](https://github.com/gakonst/ethers-rs) for their amazing implementations.

All test results can be sen at [tests/config.rs](./tests/config.rs)
